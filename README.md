# PlaylistMaker

As part of my Yandex Practicum course, I am currently developing an app called Playlist Maker. It allows users to create playlists from their favourite songs. To build the audio library, I will be using the iTunes service which enables users to search through the entire publicly accessible iTunes library. Furthermore, the iTunes database offers the ability to listen to snippets of the found audio tracks. This feature allows users to listen to a song before adding it to their playlist and make sure that they have found what they need.
A pleasant and intuitive interface design for the app was provided by the design team of the course, the project has the potential for further development and the addition of new features.

As I develop this app, I will go through the path of a developer from start to finish. This journey includes:
* Layout and navigation: I will place the interface elements on the app screen and set up movement between screens. This requires knowledge of principles of inheritance and method overriding.
* User interaction with elements on the screen: I will use interfaces and anonymous classes to enable users to interact with the app's elements.
* Organizing information in the app - lists: the vast majority of apps on Google Play are built around lists. I will learn how to create different types of lists using generics and various techniques for working with collections in Kotlin.
* Network communication: most apps require some form of information to be obtained from the server via the Internet. I will learn about the tools used to exchange data over the network, including data classes and constructors.
* Data storage: Android can store data in different ways, and I will learn to use various methods - from storing data in RAM to databases. This topic requires knowledge ranging from working with primitive types to describing classes.
* Architecture: the code and interaction between classes in the project must be properly and efficiently organized. I will learn about the principles of code organization and how to apply them, requiring a comprehensive understanding of OOP
